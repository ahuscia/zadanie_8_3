            <p>When we first came here,<br> 
                We were cold and we were clear,
                With no colours on our skin, 
                We were light and paper-thin.
                And when we first came here, 
                We were cold and we were clear, 
                With no colours on our skin, 
                Till you let the
                spectrum in.</p>
            <p>Say my name, And every colour illuminates, We are shining, And we’ll never be afraid again. Say my name! As every
                colour illuminates! We are shining! And we’ll never be afraid again! Say my name! As every colour illuminates!
                We are shining! And we’ll never be afraid again!</p>
            <p>And when we come for you, We’ll be dressed up all in blue, With the ocean in our arms, Kiss your eyes and kiss
                your palms. And when it’s time to pray, We’ll be dressed up all in grey, With metal on our tongues, And silver
                in our lungs.</p>
